**THIS REPOSITORY IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND MAKES USE OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT PUBLICALLY ACCESSIBLE NOR STABLE.** 
APIs are currently in flux and will change rapidly.  Do not rely on this code to determine what to use in your own projects.

This is being converted by hand to use CVR Lua Scripting, and is being used to test what needs to be added or removed to the APIs of CVR Lua.

Original README below:

There's a speedtree oak tree in the published world that I've excluded from the
repo (since I didn't make it), but other than that the repo should reflect the
[published vrchat world](
